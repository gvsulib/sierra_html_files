# GVSU's Customized HTML Files for Sierr'a WebPAC Pro

From time to time I get asked about the HTML files for our [heavily customized OPAC](http://matthew.reidsrow.com/articles/http://matthew.reidsrow.com/articles/170). Well, here they are! You can also find the custom CSS and JavaSCript we use to further modify things at [github.com/gvsulib/opac](https://github.com/gvsulib/opac).

## Questions?

Let me know if I can help!
